# AirQualityMonitorArduinoUno
Air Quality Monitoring System using Arduino

This Project is licensed under as GPL 3.0 (General Public License).

Existing system:

Keeping the effects of air pollution in mind such as respiratory diseases, declining mortality rate and rise in the earth’s temperature many systems and facilities have been developed to monitor the status of air pollution.

The air quality in current time is monitored either through the domestic air monitoring systems or through data provided by meteorological agencies collected by weather stations in the form of news feeds on TV, internet or radio broadcasts.

Most of the people still rely to the latter way to monitor their surrounding air because of the big size and high cost of domestic air purifying and monitoring devices. The problem regarding air quality monitoring is not with the accuracy of data provided by the weather agencies. The actual problems encountered are: -

•	The data provided is instantaneously after a regular interval say an hour or a few and is not real-time.

•	The data is collected through limited monitoring stations located at places such as public parks or bus stands. So, the data which you view may belong to your city, but it may not belong to your locality.


Proposed system: 

There is a strong need to monitor air quality in real-time whether in home or office. Our proposed system offers a light weight, compact and low-cost device that monitors the quality of air in real-time and sends the status to android device.
The proposed system is an IOT based device that collects the data through various sensors and processes them using an Arduino microcontroller board to determine the quality of air and then send the results to mobile via networking module via internet.
